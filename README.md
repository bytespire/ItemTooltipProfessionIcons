# ItemTooltipProfessionIcons
**An addon for World of Warcraft: Classic (Vanilla, TBC & Wrath)**

I created this addon to help me filter which items to keep/vendor/trade.

Item tooltips are modified to display icons of the professions that can use the item as a crafting ingredient.

**Additional features:**
- Classic appears to have numerous quests that require trade items to complete. Display a quest icon within an item's tooltip to indicate if it is required for a quest (ie. only the normal tradable items such beast parts for cooking quests, frost oil, hillman's cloak). Tradable quest items could have some demand on the AH
- Configuration dialog which allows the user to control which profession icons are displayed, control which faction/class/profession quest items are tracked, modify the icon size and toggle icons for items obtained via vendors
- Tracking items that can be exchanged for Darkmoon Faire Prize Tickets. These items may have some demand/value once the faire becomes available
